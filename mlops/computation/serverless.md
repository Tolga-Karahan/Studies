    Serverless allows us to focus on our application without thinking on provisioning and managing infrastructure.
    It is adaptable to demand by automatic scaling. It utilizes event-driven architecture. Whenever a specific 
    event occurs, it provisions the infrastructure to fulfill the demand and executes the code.

    Serverless applications are event-driven and loosely coupled via technology agnostic APIs or messaging. 
    They consume and produce events. Integration between those components is usually asynchronous with messaging.
    
    Cloud services also provided monitoring for serverless functions. For example, AWS Lambda automatically
    monitors lambda functions and sends metrics such as number of requests, the latency per request, and the
    number of requests with errors to CloudWatch.
