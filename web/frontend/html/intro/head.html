        <h1>What's in the head of HTML???</h1>
        <p>Content of HTML head section doesn't appear on pages. It contains information such as the page title, links to CSS, custom<br>
           favicons and other metadata. Browsers use the information in &lt;head&gt; section to render the page accordingly. &lt;title&gt;<br>
           element in the &lt;head&gt; is title of the overall HTML document. Sometimes &lt;h1&gt; tag in the body also referred as title of the<br>
           page. While &lt;h1&gt; is the title of the content that is visible on the browser, title in the head section is title of the all document.<br>
           Title contents are also used in the search results.</p>

        <p>&lt;meta&gt; tag in head section is used to add metadata to the document. &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; is common metadata<br>
           in HTML documents. It defines the document's character encoding. utf-8 is sufficient for any character from any language.<br> For example
           to render Japanese we need it: ご飯が熱い。.</p>   

        <p>Many metadata information has a name to indicate what type of metadata it is and a content. Some metadata is used by<br> 
           search engines so defining them is a good practice for SEO. For example content of description metadata is shown in the<br>
           search results.</p>

        <p>You can add references to custom icons in metadata to further enrich the design. Most common one is favicon which<br>
           appears in favorites or bookmarks lists. It might appear on tab as well depending on the browser:<br>
           &lt;link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"&gt;</p>

        <p>We can set the language of the page in head as well. In this way the page will be indexed better by search engines to<br>
           show it in the language specific results.</p>
