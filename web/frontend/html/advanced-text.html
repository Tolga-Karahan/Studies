        <h1>Advanced text in HTML</h1>
        <p>There is also a third type of list in HTML which is called description lists. Description lists are used in cases in which a set of items and their descriptions are shown.<br>
           For example terms and definitions or Q/A. We can use multiple description per item.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Unordered list</dt>
            <dd>A list consists of elements whose order doesn't matter.</dd>
            <dt>Ordered list</dt>
            <dd>A list consists of elements whose order does matter.</dd>
            <dt>Definition list</dt>
            <dd>A list consists of items and their descriptions as it is the case with this one.</dd>
            <dd>Though it is not frequent as previous ones.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>To quote some block level content, we should use &lt;blockquote&gt; element to indicate this and we should include a url that is pointing to source of the quote inside<br>
           cite attribute. Browser will put quoted content inside an indented paragraph by default:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
            <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
               Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>                
        </blockquote>

        <p>Inline quotations also works in the same way but they use &lt;q&gt; element to quote content:</p>
        <p>The quote element &lt;q&gt; is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q></p>
        <p>cite attribute is not considered by browsers, so to make it appear on the page we should add via other means such as html, css or javascript.</p>
        <p>There is also a &lt;cite&gt; tag which is used to contain title of the quoted source.</p>
        <p>The quote element &lt;q&gt; is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q>
           According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"><cite>MDN q page</cite></a>.</p>

        <p>&lt;abbr&gt; element is for putting abbreviations inside and giving expansion in title attribute.</p> 
        <p>We use <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to structure our web page.</p>

        <p>&lt;address&gt; element is used to give contact information for a person.</p>

        <p>For superscript and subscript we use &lt;sup&gt; and &lt;sub&gt; tags respectively. Today is: 8<sup>th</sup> of July 2021. Caffeine's formula is:
           C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
        </p>

        <dl>There are also some tags which are useful for representing computer code:
            <dt>&lt;code&gt;</dt>
            <dd>For marking up computer code.</dd>
            <dt>&lt;pre&gt;</dt>
            <dd>For preserving spaces in HTML as is otherwise they are just ignored from the browser.</dd>
            <dt>&lt;var&gt;</dt>
            <dd>For specifically marking up variable names.<dd>
            <dt>&lt;kbd&gt;</dt>
            <dd>For marking up keyboard or any other type of input entered into computer.</dd>
            <dt>&lt;samp&gt;</dt>
            <dd>For marking up the output of a computer program.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>There are multiple ways of writing dates, but computers might not be able to recognize each one. To indicate that it's a date we use &lt;time&gt; tag. 
           By doing so we<br>can easily grab all dates in a page.</p>
        <time datetime="2022-07-08">08 July 2022</time>
