## Values
    Every CSS property has a value type that defines the set of values allowed for the property. CSS value or data types are denoted in angle brackets such as: <color>.

### Lengths
    There are two types of lengths in CSS: relative and absolute. For example px is an absolute type. Relative units are relative to something else like parent properties such as font-size, em, rem, vw(viewport width), vh(viewport hight) are some examples. em is relative to the font-size of the parent in case it is a typographical property such as font-size, in case of other properties such as width it is relative to the font size of the element itself. rem is font size of the root element. vw and vh is relative to the viewport, 10vw means 10% of the viewport width.
