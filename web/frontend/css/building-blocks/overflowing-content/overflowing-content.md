<link rel="stylesheet" href="overflowing-content.css" type="text/css">

When content can't fit into the box with limited size, overflow happens. It happens because whenever possible, CSS doesn't hide content, doing so can cause data loss. In CSS, overflow property determines whether overflowed content will be visible, hidden or scrolled. Scroll doesn't appear if there is no overflow.

<div class="overflow">Overflowed Content</div>
<div class="overflow-scrolled">Overflowed Content</div>
<div class="overflow-scrolled2">There is no overflow but still scroll is there!</div>
