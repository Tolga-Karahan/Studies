## SOLID Principles
    - Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one responsibility.
    - Open/Closed Principle: A class should be open to extension but closed to
    modification.
    - Liskov Substitution Principle: Any class can be substituted for its superclass.
    - Interface Segregation: A class should have the smallest interface possible.
    - Dependency Inversion: High-level and low-level modules should be independent
    from each other so that high-level modules should be reusable and unaffected by changes is low-level modules.
